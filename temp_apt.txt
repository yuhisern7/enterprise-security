### Defense Against Advanced and Persistent Threats (APT)

Battle-Hardened AI disrupts APT campaigns through multi-stage detection across the entire MITRE ATT&CK kill chain:

**Early Detection (TA0043 Reconnaissance  TA0001 Initial Access):**
- Reconnaissance attempts (T1595, T1046, T1590) detected via behavioral heuristics and graph intelligence
- Initial access attempts (T1190, T1133) blocked via signature matching and autoencoder anomaly detection
- **Result:** APT campaigns exposed before establishing foothold

**Containment (TA0006 Credential Access  TA0008 Lateral Movement):**
- Credential attacks (T1110, T1078) stopped via LSTM sequence analysis and reputation tracking
- Lateral movement (T1021) mapped via graph intelligence and kernel telemetry
- **Layer 20 Trust Degradation:** Permanently scars entity trustAPT "try again later" strategies fail

**Persistent Memory:**
- Each attack strengthens local models and contributes anonymized patterns to global relay
- Cross-session reputation tracks APT infrastructure across campaigns
- **Layer 19 Causal Inference:** Distinguishes APT from legitimate operations (eliminates false positives)
