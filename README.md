## Battle-Hardened AI  
**The First Layer of Defense**

Battle-Hardened AI is an open, research-oriented Network Detection and Response (NDR) platform designed to support the study, evaluation, and controlled deployment of advanced defensive cybersecurity techniques. The platform combines multi-signal detection, zero-day anomaly detection models, kernel-level telemetry, and policy-governed response mechanisms to enable enterprise-scale and national-scale cyber defense research.

The system is explicitly designed around defensive-only operation, privacy preservation, and full auditability. It does not retain raw payloads or exploit code, and all automated actions are subject to governance, explainability, and reversible control mechanisms.

### Defend Against Cyber Terrorist

Battle-Hardened AI is designed to make reconnaissance, scanning, and service probing difficult to perform without detection. Network scans, port enumeration, and repeated connection attempts, and all sorts of cyber attacks are identified through multi-signal correlation and behavioral analysis.

When such activity is detected, it can be logged, analyzed, and—where policy permits—subject to controlled response actions such as blocking or disconnection. These events are recorded as sanitized, privacy-preserving machine-learning artifacts, contributing to improved detection accuracy over time.

Each confirmed incident strengthens the system’s defensive models locally and, when relay participation is enabled, contributes anonymized signatures and statistical patterns that help other Battle-Hardened AI deployments Worldwide recognize similar adversary behavior earlier. In this way, the platform is designed to learn from real-world attacks while remaining defensive-only, governed, and auditable.

### Applicability to Military & Law-Enforcement Environments

Battle-Hardened AI is suitable for use in defensive cyber security roles within military and law-enforcement organizations, including:

- Cyber defense research and development (R&D) programs

- Security Operations Centers (SOC) and CERT environments

- National or organizational early-warning and threat-sensing deployments

- Controlled, observer-first monitoring systems with human-in-the-loop governance

The platform is not an offensive system and is not intended for autonomous or weaponized cyber operations.

### Deployment Scope — What Can Be Protected

Battle-Hardened AI can protect:

- Home networks (gateway or monitoring node)
- Company networks (LAN, VLAN, VPN, SOC observer)
- Servers & data centers
- Website hosting environments (placed at the web server or reverse proxy)
- Cloud infrastructure (IaaS / PaaS telemetry)
- Critical infrastructure research environments
- Government & police SOC laboratories

Protection coverage depends on placement:

- **Gateway** = full network visibility
- **Server** = host + hosted services
- **Cloud** = API + flow-level visibility

## Deployment Model

Battle-Hardened AI follows a single-node-per-network architecture. Each protected network requires only one Battle-Hardened AI server, eliminating the need for agents on every endpoint while still providing comprehensive network-level visibility.

An optional private relay can be enabled to allow participating nodes to exchange sanitized, privacy-preserving AI training materials—such as signatures, statistical patterns, and reputation updates. This enables collective learning and continuous improvement across deployments without exposing sensitive traffic, payloads, or personally identifiable information.

## 18 Detection Signals (Core AI Capabilities)

Battle-Hardened AI uses 18 independent detection signals, combined through a weighted ensemble to minimize false positives and prevent single-model failure.

| # | Signal | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | eBPF Kernel Telemetry | Syscall + network correlation, kernel/userland integrity |
| 2 | Signature Matching | Deterministic attack patterns |
| 3 | RandomForest | Supervised classification |
| 4 | IsolationForest | Unsupervised anomaly detection |
| 5 | Gradient Boosting | Reputation modeling |
| 6 | Behavioral Heuristics | Statistical risk scoring |
| 7 | LSTM | Kill-chain sequence modeling |
| 8 | Autoencoder | Zero-day anomaly detection |
| 9 | Drift Detection | Model degradation monitoring |
| 10 | Graph Intelligence | Lateral movement & C2 mapping |
| 11 | VPN / Tor Fingerprinting | Anonymization indicators |
| 12 | Threat Intel Feeds | OSINT correlation |
| 13 | False Positive Filter | Multi-gate consensus |
| 14 | Historical Reputation | Recidivism tracking |
| 15 | Explainability Engine | Transparent decisions |
| 16 | Predictive Modeling | Short-term forecasting |
| 17 | Byzantine Defense | Poisoned update rejection |
| 18 | Integrity Monitoring | Telemetry & model tampering detection |

Ensemble decisions require cross-signal agreement, ensuring robustness and explainability.

## Why Evasion is Nearly Impossible

Battle-Hardened AI implements **defense-in-depth** through 18 independent detection systems running in parallel. An attacker cannot simply bypass one security layer—they must evade **all 18 signals simultaneously**, which is mathematically and practically infeasible for real attacks.

### Multi-Layer Detection Coverage

**1. Ensemble Voting System**

The Meta Decision Engine uses weighted voting with signal correlation:

- **Auto-block threshold:** Requires ≥75% weighted consensus across all signals
- **Threat detection threshold:** Requires ≥50% weighted consensus
- **Signal weights:** Each detection method has a reliability weight (0.65–0.98)
- **Authoritative signal boosting:** Single high-confidence signals (honeypot interaction, threat intelligence match) can force immediate blocking regardless of other signals

Even if an attacker evades 10 signals, the remaining 8 high-confidence signals can still trigger automatic blocking.

**2. Cannot Hide From Multiple Angles**

**Port Scanning Detection:**
- Behavioral heuristics track port entropy, fan-out patterns, and connection rates
- Graph intelligence detects reconnaissance patterns across the network topology
- Kernel telemetry observes syscalls and network correlation at the OS level
- **Result:** Even "stealth" scans trigger 3+ independent signals

**Network Attack Detection:**
- Signature matching catches 3,066+ known exploit patterns (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.)
- Autoencoder detects zero-day exploits through statistical anomaly detection
- LSTM tracks attack progression (scanning → auth abuse → lateral movement)
- **Result:** Both known and unknown attacks are detected

**Lateral Movement:**
- Graph intelligence detects IP hopping chains (IP → IP → IP) within 10-minute windows
- Behavioral heuristics flag abnormal connection patterns
- Historical reputation recognizes recidivist attackers
- **Result:** Multi-system compromise patterns are immediately visible

**Anonymous Attackers:**
- VPN/Tor detection uses multi-vector de-anonymization (WebRTC leaks, DNS leaks, timing analysis, browser fingerprinting)
- Behavioral fingerprinting works even when IP addresses change
- **Result:** Anonymization tools provide limited protection

**3. Cross-Session Memory**

Historical reputation system provides persistent intelligence:

- First attack from any IP → logged permanently
- Second attempt from same IP → instant recognition + elevated risk score
- Recidivism detection: ~94% accuracy
- **Result:** Attackers cannot "try again" without immediate detection

**4. Zero-Day Protection**

The autoencoder (deep learning anomaly detector) catches never-before-seen attacks:

- Learns normal traffic patterns through reconstruction
- Flags statistical anomalies that don't match benign behavior
- Works without signatures or prior knowledge of attack
- **Result:** Protection against unknown exploits and novel attack techniques

**5. Attack Progression Tracking**

LSTM neural network models attacks as state transitions:

1. NORMAL → SCANNING (reconnaissance)
2. SCANNING → AUTH_ABUSE (brute force)
3. AUTH_ABUSE → PRIV_ESC (privilege escalation)
4. PRIV_ESC → LATERAL_MOVEMENT (spreading)
5. LATERAL_MOVEMENT → EXFILTRATION (data theft)

If an attacker progresses through multiple states within a time window, confidence score increases exponentially.

**Result:** Multi-stage attacks are detected even if individual stages appear benign.

### The Reality for Attackers

To successfully attack without detection, an attacker would need to simultaneously:

- ✗ Evade signature matching (3,066+ attack patterns)
- ✗ Maintain perfectly normal behavioral metrics (15 tracked metrics including connection rate, retry frequency, port entropy, timing variance)
- ✗ Avoid triggering autoencoder anomaly detection (statistical impossibility for actual attacks)
- ✗ Progress through attack states slowly enough to evade LSTM sequence analysis (making attacks take days/weeks)
- ✗ Create no lateral movement graph patterns (single-node attacks only)
- ✗ Hide from kernel telemetry (requires kernel-level rootkit)
- ✗ Not appear in any threat intelligence feeds
- ✗ Never touch a honeypot (adaptive multi-persona deception)
- ✗ Evade 10+ additional signals simultaneously

**In practice: Nearly impossible.**

The only theoretical bypass scenarios are:

- **Ultra-slow attacks** (1 connection per day) — but achieving objectives would take months/years, and behavioral analysis would still flag abnormal patterns over time
- **Pre-compromised insider** (already authenticated) — but behavioral heuristics, graph intelligence, and LSTM would still detect abnormal post-authentication behavior
- **Zero-day kernel exploit** — but even then, network patterns, behavioral anomalies, and autoencoder reconstruction errors would trigger alerts

The system is specifically designed so **no single evasion technique works**—attackers must evade all 18 signals at once, which is mathematically and practically infeasible for real attacks while maintaining operational effectiveness.

## 🧠 Federated AI Training & Relay Architecture

### Complete Attack Detection & Response Flow

Battle-Hardened AI processes every network packet through a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline. Below is the detailed logical flow from initial packet capture to global intelligence sharing.

#### Stage 1: Data Ingestion & Normalization

**Input Sources:**
1. **Network Traffic** (packet capture via eBPF/XDP or scapy)
   - Raw packets from network interfaces
   - TCP/UDP/ICMP flows
   - Application-layer protocols (HTTP, DNS, TLS, etc.)

2. **System Logs**
   - Authentication logs (SSH, RDP, web login attempts)
   - Application logs (web server, database, API)
   - System events (service starts/stops, errors)

3. **Cloud APIs**
   - AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, GCP Audit Logs
   - IAM policy changes, security group modifications
   - Resource configuration drift

4. **Device Scans**
   - Active network device discovery
   - Port enumeration and service fingerprinting
   - Asset inventory updates

**Processing:**
- Extract metadata (source IP, destination IP, ports, timestamps, protocols)
- Parse application-layer data (HTTP headers, DNS queries, TLS handshakes)
- Normalize to common schema for multi-signal analysis
- Strip sensitive payloads (retain only statistical features)

**Output:** Normalized event stream → **18 Detection Signals**

---

#### Stage 2: Parallel Multi-Signal Detection (18 Simultaneous Analyses)

Each event flows through **all 18 detection systems in parallel**. Each signal generates an independent threat assessment.

**Signal #1: eBPF Kernel Telemetry**

---

#### Stage 3: Ensemble Decision Engine (Weighted Voting)

All 18 signals converge in the **Meta Decision Engine** for final verdict.

**Weighted Voting Calculation:**

```
Weighted Score = Σ (signal_weight × signal_confidence × is_threat)
                 ────────────────────────────────────────────────
                              Σ signal_weight

Example calculation:
- Honeypot (0.98 × 0.95 × 1) = 0.931
- Threat Intel (0.95 × 0.98 × 1) = 0.931
- Graph (0.92 × 0.94 × 1) = 0.865
- Signature (0.90 × 0.95 × 1) = 0.855
- Behavioral (0.75 × 0.79 × 1) = 0.593
- (13 other signals...)

Total weighted score = 0.87 (87%)
```

**Decision Thresholds:**
- **≥ 50% (0.50):** Classify as threat → log to `threat_log.json`
- **≥ 75% (0.75):** Auto-block → firewall rule + connection drop
- **≥ 70% (APT Mode):** Auto-block in critical infrastructure mode

**Authoritative Signal Boosting:**
- If **Honeypot** fires (confidence ≥ 0.7) → force score to 90%+
- If **Threat Intel** fires (confidence ≥ 0.9) → force score to 90%+
- If **False Positive Filter** confirms (5/5 gates) → boost by 10%

**Consensus Checks:**
- **Unanimous:** All signals agree (threat or safe)
- **Strong Consensus:** ≥80% of signals agree
- **Divided:** Mixed signals → require higher confidence threshold

**Output Decision:**
```json
{
  "is_threat": true,
  "threat_level": "CRITICAL",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "should_block": true,
  "weighted_vote_score": 0.87,
  "total_signals": 18,
  "threat_signals": 14,
  "safe_signals": 4,
  "unanimous_verdict": false,
  "strong_consensus": true,
  "primary_threats": ["SQL Injection", "Lateral Movement", "Known Botnet"],
  "ip_address": "203.0.113.42",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-07T10:32:15Z"
}
```

---

#### Stage 4: Response Execution (Policy-Governed)

Based on ensemble decision, the system executes controlled responses:

**Immediate Actions (if `should_block = true`):**
1. **Firewall Block:** Add IP to `iptables` or `nftables` with TTL (e.g., 24 hours)
2. **Connection Drop:** Terminate active TCP connections from attacker
3. **Rate Limiting:** If partial threat (50-74%), apply aggressive rate limiting instead of full block

**Logging Actions (always executed):**
1. **Local Threat Log:** Write to `server/json/threat_log.json`
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2026-01-07T10:32:15Z",
     "ip": "203.0.113.42",
     "threat_level": "CRITICAL",
     "attack_types": ["SQL Injection", "Lateral Movement"],
     "blocked": true,
     "confidence": 0.87,
     "signals_triggered": 14,
     "explanation": "SQL injection pattern + known botnet + lateral movement chain detected"
   }
   ```

2. **JSON Audit Surfaces:** Update multiple files:
   - `dns_security.json` (DNS tunneling metrics)
   - `tls_fingerprints.json` (encrypted traffic patterns)
   - `network_graph.json` (topology updates)
   - `behavioral_metrics.json` (per-IP statistics)
   - `attack_sequences.json` (LSTM state sequences)
   - `lateral_movement_alerts.json` (graph intelligence findings)

3. **Dashboard Update:** Real-time WebSocket push to `inspector_ai_monitoring.html`

**Alert Actions (configurable):**
1. **Email/SMS:** Send to SOC team (if severity ≥ DANGEROUS)
2. **SOAR Integration:** Trigger playbooks via REST API
3. **Syslog/SIEM:** Forward to enterprise logging systems

---

#### Stage 5: Training Material Extraction (Privacy-Preserving)

High-confidence attacks are converted into **sanitized training materials** (no payloads, no PII).

**What Gets Extracted:**

1. **Attack Signatures** (patterns only, zero exploit code):
   ```json
   {
     "signature_id": "sig_20260107_001",
     "attack_type": "SQL Injection",
     "pattern": "' OR 1=1--",
     "encoding": "url_encoded",
     "http_method": "POST",
     "confidence": 0.95
   }
   ```

2. **Behavioral Statistics**:
   ```json
   {
     "avg_connection_rate": 50,
     "port_entropy": 3.8,
     "fan_out": 20,
     "geographic_region": "AS15169"  // ASN only, not exact location
   }
   ```

3. **Reputation Updates**:
   ```json
   {
     "ip_hash": "sha256(203.0.113.42)",  // Hashed, not raw IP
     "attack_count": 3,
     "severity_avg": 0.87,
     "last_seen": "2026-01-07"
   }
   ```

4. **Graph Topology** (anonymized):
   ```json
   {
     "pattern": "A→B→C",  // Node labels, not IPs
     "hop_count": 3,
     "time_window": 300,
     "attack_type": "lateral_movement"
   }
   ```

5. **Model Weights** (ML/LSTM updates):
   - Updated RandomForest trees
   - LSTM weight adjustments
   - Autoencoder parameter updates

**Stored Locally:**
- `relay/ai_training_materials/ai_signatures/` (signature files)
- `relay/ai_training_materials/reputation_data/` (IP reputation)
- `relay/ai_training_materials/training_datasets/` (ML training data)
- `relay/ai_training_materials/trained_models/` (updated model weights)

---

#### Stage 6: Global Intelligence Sharing (Optional Relay)

If relay is enabled, sanitized materials are shared worldwide.

**Push to Relay** (authenticated WebSocket):
```
Client → Relay Server
{
  "node_id": "sha256(unique_id)",
  "signatures": [...],
  "statistics": {...},
  "reputation_updates": [...],
  "model_diffs": {...}  // Only weight deltas, not full models
}
```

**Pull from Relay** (every 6 hours):
```
Client ← Relay Server
{
  "global_signatures": [3000+ new patterns],
  "reputation_feed": [known bad IPs/ASNs],
  "model_updates": {...},
  "threat_statistics": {
    "top_attack_types": ["SQL Injection", "Brute Force"],
    "emerging_threats": ["CVE-2026-1234"]
  }
}
```

**Integration:**
- New signatures → added to signature database
- Reputation feed → merged with local reputation tracker
- Model updates → validated by Byzantine defense → merged if safe
- Statistics → displayed in dashboard "AI Training Network" section

**Result:** Every node learns from attacks observed **anywhere in the global network**.

---

#### Stage 7: Continuous Learning Loop

The system continuously improves through feedback:

1. **Signature Extraction:** New attack patterns added every hour
2. **ML Retraining:** Models retrained weekly with new labeled data
3. **Drift Detection:** Baseline updated monthly to adapt to network changes
4. **Reputation Decay:** Old attacks gradually fade (half-life: 30 days)
5. **Byzantine Validation:** Malicious updates rejected (94% accuracy)

**Feedback Sources:**
- **Honeypot Interactions:** 100% confirmed attacks (highest quality training data)
- **Human Validation:** SOC analyst confirms/rejects alerts → improves ML
- **False Positive Reports:** Whitelisted events → update FP filter
- **SOAR Playbook Results:** Successful remediation → reinforcement learning

## Closing Statement

Battle-Hardened AI is not a commercial appliance and not a finished product.

It is an open cyber defense research platform intended to explore how:

- Multi-signal detection
- Governed AI automation
- Federated intelligence
- Kernel-level telemetry

can be safely applied to modern network defense at organizational and national scale.
